# Pommunism Twitter bot

Greetings, comrade! This repository holds the code that created the [@pommunism Twitter bot](https://twitter.com/pommunism).

What is "pommunism," you ask? Pommunism is a portmanteau of **Pomeranian dog** and **communism**. As you might expected, the purpose of this Twitter bot is to tweet random images of Pomeranian dogs accompanied by quotes about communism.

The Pommunism Twitter Bot is written in Python, and comprises of an automated tweeting script (```autotweet.py```), a BrainyQuote scraper (```brainscape.py```, which I initially created in [another repository](https://github.com/alainakafkes/brainscrape)), and script that downloads way too many Pomeranian pictures using the Bing API (```pommunism.py```).

Thanks for checking out my work, comrade. ☭
